### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Ludek and I am primarily interested in the development of state-of-the-art methods in the machine learning field. I publish my thoughts and notes about the field on [AITU's blog](https://www.aitu.group/blog).

Here are some of the most relevant projects I have done in the past:

- 2023 / Mutagenicity Prediction / Graph Neural Networks, W&B / [link](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/epfl-cs502/tree/main/coursework/homeworks/hw2)
- 2023 / Game Development Design Tool / Neural Cellur Automata, Quality Diversity Optimisation / [link](https://github.com/Interactive-NCA)
- 2022 / ML Library / Neural Net, Linear Regression, Decision Tree / [link](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/nano-learn)
- 2022 / Power Production Prediction / Grid Search, Neural Net, Decision Tree / [link](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/time-series-prediction)
- 2022 / Marathon Race Data Visualisation / Plotly, Dash / [link](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/marathonviz)
